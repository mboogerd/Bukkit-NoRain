Bukkit-NoRain
=============

This is a least-imaginative re-implementation of the better known NoRain plugin by ellbristow, which can be found here:
http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/norain/

Ellbristows' plugin allows you to configure per world whether rain should be allowed but apparently crashes for newer (1.7+) versions of bukkit/spigot.

This implementation should work for bukkit/spigot 1.7.X but is not configurable. It simply prevents rain from starting in any world associated with your bukkit/spigot install. I've build this mainly for my own server and shared it so others can use. Updates to this will likely occur when I am ready to update my server. It's unlikely I will further extend the functionality of this plugin. If you need the per-world configuration, I suggest you create an issue with the original repository, which can be found here:
